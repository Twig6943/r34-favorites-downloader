# r34-favorites-downloader

Extremely simple python script, that can download any users favorites from rule34.xxx
Also very easy to modify to fit your own needs.

1. Enter profile ID
2. Enter page to download
3. Don't touch the browser (It will operate itself)

### Requirements
- selenium (Python module)
- webdriver_manager (Python module)
- wget (Python module)
- Firefox Browser
- Have every other extension other than ublock origin disabled

### Extra features of this fork
- Uses Cloudflare to accsess the site
- Can download multiple pages at once
- Allows extensions (Only use ublock origin tho otherwise it might break) 

I literally tweaked some stuff to get it working again and added some features using ChatGPT. Please don't credit me for this in any way. I just used chatgpt like a bitch to get it working. I was going to contact the original developer but his socials seem dead. Most of the code in this repo is written by @owosu . This repo will be taken down if I manage to contact @owosu somehow.
