I literally tweaked some stuff to get with ChatGPT (Useragent stuff) to get it working again and added some features. Please don't credit me for this in any way. I just used ChatGPT like a bitch to get it working. I was going to contact the original developer but his socials seem dead. Most of the code in this repo is written by @owosu . This repo will be taken down if I manage to contact @owosu somehow.
